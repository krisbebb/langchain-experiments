Primary subject area: science
Other subject areas: none
Subject overview: Inspire children's natural curiosity about the world around them through exciting Science investigations, using everyday materials.
Year level: 5
Unit Name: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems
Unit Big Question: Where do plants and animals live and why do they live there?
Unit Overview: In this Kindergarten unit, students will engage in a range of stimulating activities to develop their understanding of what living things need to survive and grow. They will explore real world phenomena, such as finding out how a giraffe drinks water, watching a weaverbird build its nest and contemplating how we can help look after our home, Planet Earth. Together, the lessons develop relevant elements of the NGSS kindergarten storyline. Each lesson interweaves the three dimensions of the NGSS through guided investigations and collaborative activities that form a coherent learning sequence. Student inquiry is focused on developing their understanding of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive and the relationship between their needs and where they live. The unit includes a formative assessment tool: a grading rubric that aligns with the relevant checkpoint opportunities in each lesson. The suggested lesson times are a guide. Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete.
Topic Name: Unknown
Topic Overview: Unknown
Lesson Overview: The phenomena of animals drinking and eating are the basis of this lesson, which begins with a delightful image of a bird drinking water. Students view several images and decide which are living things and which are not. Then they discuss the reasons for their decisions. Next, students watch several short videos about a variety of animals drinking in different ways. Students explore the different types of food that animals eat through a video, images, and an interactive. They compare the needs of animals to their own and describe the pattern they notice—that both animals and humans need food and water to live and grow. They further differentiate this by explaining that some animals eat only plants, some eat only other animals, and some eat both. Students make a personal connection by describing things they like to eat and drink. Students are then challenged to list the survival needs of one particular animal and to compare the needs of a human baby with the needs of an adult.
Phenomena: Animals drinking, animals eating
Curriculum: Next Generation Science Standards
NGSS Performance Expectations: K-LS1-1, Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.
Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs): LS1.C, Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms, All animals need food in order to live and grow. They obtain their food from plants or from other animals. Plants need water and light to live and grow.
Engineering Practices (SEPs): Analyzing and Interpretng Data, Use Observations (firsthand or from media) to describe patterns and/or relationships in the natural and designed world(s) in order to answer scientific questions and solve problems.
Concepts (CCCs): Patterns, Patterns in the natural and human designed world can be observed, used to describe phenomena, and used as evidence.
Connections to Nature of Science (NOS):  Science Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence, Scientists look for patterns and order when making observations about the world.
Learning Targets: Students will be able to: - Identify living things and nonliving things. - State that animals need food and water to survive. - Describe the foods that different animals eat. 
Lesson Materials: Colored pencils or crayons for each student. Modeling clay or modeling dough - a small amount per student.
Teacher Reading: Background Science How do we decide if something is alive? Living things grow, change, and reproduce, among other characteristics. To do those things, living things need food and water. In later grades, students will learn that plants use sunlight to make their own food, but at this level they just need to understand that plants need sunlight to stay alive and grow. Animals depend on plants and other animals for food. Some animals, such as pandas and koalas, eat one food almost exclusively, while other animals eat a wide variety of foods. Animals that eat only other animals are called carnivores, animals that eat only plants are called herbivores, and animals that eat both plants and other animals are called omnivores. All animals have a mouth—a body part that is specialized for eating and drinking in whatever way they do.
Lesson introduction: Show the students the image of the bird and ask: What is this bird doing? It is likely students will correctly answer “drinking.” Ask whether anyone has watched a bird having a drink. If some students own a pet bird, ask them to share their experience of caring for the bird and providing it with water.`;
