 Lesson name: Counting with Friends! Primary subject area: Maths. Other subject areas: none. Subject overview: Introduce children to the basics of counting and number recognition through fun and engaging activities. Year level: 1. Unit Name: Counting and Cardinality. Unit Big Question: How can we use counting to understand numbers? Unit Overview: In this Year 1 unit, students will explore the basics of counting and cardinality through a range of activities. They will learn to count up to 10 objects, recognize numbers up to 10, and understand the relationship between numbers and quantities. Through hands-on activities, students will learn to count objects, match numbers to sets of objects, and compare sets of objects. They will also learn to recognize numbers up to 10 and understand the relationship between numbers and quantities. The unit includes a formative assessment tool: a grading rubric that aligns with the relevant checkpoint opportunities in each lesson. The suggested lesson times are a guide. Taking into account the learning requirements of their class, teachers should pace the activities and lessons accordingly. Each lesson may take two or more sessions to complete. Topic Name: Counting and Cardinality. Topic Overview: Students will learn to count up to 10 objects, recognize numbers up to 10, and understand the relationship between numbers and quantities. Lesson Overview: In this lesson, students will learn to count up to 10 objects. They will use their counting skills to match numbers to sets of objects and compare sets of objects. They will also learn to recognize numbers up to 10 and understand the relationship between numbers and quantities. To begin, students will watch a short video about counting with friends. They will then practice counting up to 10 objects with a partner. Next, students will match numbers to sets of objects and compare sets of objects. Finally, they will practice recognizing numbers up to 10. Phenomena: Counting, matching numbers to sets of objects, comparing sets of objects. Curriculum: Common Core State Standards. CCSS Math Content Standards: K.CC.A.1, Count to 100 by ones and by tens. K.CC.A.2, Count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1). K.CC.A.3, Write numbers from 0 to 20. Represent a number of objects with a written numeral 0-20 (with 0 representing a count of no objects). K.CC.B.4, Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality. Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs): K.CC.B.4.A, When counting objects, say the number names in the standard order, pairing each object with one and only one number name and each number name with one and only one object. K.CC.B.4.B, Understand that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same regardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.Engineering Practices (SEPs): Developing and Using Models, Develop and/or use a model to represent a proposed object, tool, or process.Concepts (CCCs): Cardinality, The last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same regardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.Connections to Nature of Science (NOS): Science Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence, Scientists use models to represent and explain phenomena. Learning Targets: Students will be able to: - Count up to 10 objects. - Match numbers to sets of objects. - Compare sets of objects. - Recognize numbers up to 10. Lesson Materials: Counting cards (1-10) for each student. Number cards (1-10) for each student.Teacher Reading: Background Maths Counting is an important skill for young children to learn. It helps them understand the relationship between numbers and quantities, and it is the foundation for more advanced math skills. Counting is also a great way to introduce children to the concept of cardinality, which is the understanding that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same regardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.Lesson introduction: Show the students the counting cards and ask: How many cards do we have? It is likely students will correctly answer “ten.” Ask whether anyone has ever counted something with a friend. If some students have, ask them to share their experience.
